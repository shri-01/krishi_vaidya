								<h2>Bacterial spot</h2>
								<h1>Reason of cause</h1>
								<p>Bacterial spot is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria.</p>
								<h1>
									Management and Control of Bacterial spot of bellpaper
								</h1>
								<ul>
									<li>Use disease-free seed that has been produced in western states or seed that has been hot water treated. One infested seed in 10,000 may easily result in 100% diseased plants in the field under proper conditions.</li>
									<li>Purchase only certified disease-free transplants.</li>
									<li>Practice crop rotation. Use at least 1-year rotation between tomato or pepper crops with nonhost crops.</li>
									<li>For plant beds and flats in the greenhouse, keep the house as dry as possible and avoid splashing water. Spray with fixed coppers (i.e., tribasic copper sulfate and copper hydroxide), alone or in combination with 200 ppm streptomycin (11b/100 gal water in the copper spray), with the addition of spreader-sticker to improve the effectiveness of the spray. Streptomycin cannot be used in the field. Start field treatment as soon as disease appears, using a fixed copper plus maneb 80 WP or maneb plus zinc product to prevent secondary spread of the bacterium. The combination of copper and maneb has been shown to be more effective in controlling strains of the organism that are either sensitive or tolerant to copper alone. (See Cornell Recommendations for Commercial Vegetable Production for specific rates.) Adjust spray schedules according to the weather conditions. Copper fungicides may help to reduce secondary spread, but their effectiveness is limited by rainfall and dew formation</li>
